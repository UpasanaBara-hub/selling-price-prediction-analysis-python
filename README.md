# Selling Price Prediction Analysis (Python)

## Problem Statement
Accurately estimating the selling price of products or assets is a critical challenge for businesses, as pricing directly impacts revenue, competitiveness, and customer demand. Incorrect pricing can lead to lost sales or reduced profit margins.  
This project addresses the problem of analyzing historical sales and product attribute data to identify key factors influencing selling price and to develop a data-driven approach for estimating selling prices.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze product and sales-related features to understand their impact on selling price and to apply analytical techniques for predicting selling prices based on these attributes.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains historical records related to product sales, including:
- Product or asset attributes  
- Pricing-related features  
- Transactional or market indicators  

The dataset was analyzed to understand patterns and relationships affecting selling price.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Predictive Modeling (Regression-based approach)

---

## Data Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Validation of missing values and data consistency  
- Handling of outliers affecting price distribution  
- Encoding of categorical variables where required  
- Feature selection based on relevance to selling price  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis focused on:
- Distribution of selling prices across product categories  
- Relationship between key attributes and selling price  
- Identification of variables with the strongest influence on price  
- Comparison of price trends across different segments  

---

## Key Insights
- Certain product attributes show a strong correlation with selling price  
- Higher-quality or premium features are associated with increased selling prices  
- Selling price is influenced by a combination of multiple features rather than a single factor  
- Proper feature selection improves price estimation accuracy  

---

## Business Applications
- Supports data-driven pricing strategy development  
- Assists businesses in estimating competitive and profitable selling prices  
- Helps identify features that contribute most to price differentiation  
- Demonstrates the use of predictive analytics for revenue optimization
